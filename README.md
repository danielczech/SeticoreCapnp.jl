# SeticoreCapnp

A Julia package for reading `*.hits` and `*.stamps` files created by
[seticore](https://github.com/lacker/seticore.git).

## Getting started

This package is not yet registered, so you'll have to add it by URL.  You can
use the REPL's built-in package manager:

```
julia> ]
(@v1.9) pkg> add https://github.com/david-macmahon/SeticoreCapnp.jl
```

or call `Pkg` directly:

```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/david-macmahon/SeticoreCapnp.jl")
```

Once it is installed, you can use it like this:

```julia
using SeticoreCapnp

hits = SeticoreCapnp.load_hits("mydatafile.hits")
stamps = SeticoreCapnp.load_stamps("mydatafile.hits")
```

The `load_hits` and `load_stamps` functions both return a Vector of
`OrderedDict{Symbol,Any}` objects containing hit or stamp metadata from the
specified file as well as a Vector of Arrays containing the *Filterbank* data or
*RAW voltage* data associated with each hit or stamp.

By default, the `find_hits` function will only return unique hits, even if the
file contain duplicate hits.  This is to work around a bug in some versions of
`seticore` that output duplicate hits.  If the file is known to be
duplicate-free or if you want the duplicates, pass `unique=false` to
`find_hits`.

The metadata will also contain a `:fileoffset` key that can be used with the
singular name functions `load_hit` or `load_stamp` to (re-)load just that
individual hit or stamp from the input file.

## Hits

The `OrderedDict` for a hit contains these keys:

| Key            |  Value type     | Note                                                                         |

## Native Julia interface

Being able to call the Python `capnp` package to read the Hits and Stamps
files leverages existing code and streamlines development time.  While the
translation between Julia and Python is easy and almost seamless, it is
unfortunately not very performant, which limits the scalability of this
approach.  For example, reading 1 million hits from a single Hits file took over
45 minutes!  Here is a table showing some timing and memory stats for reading
various numbers of hits from a single Hits file ranging from 10 hits to 1
million hits:

|  # Hits |   Time (s)  | Memory allocated | GC percentage |
|--------:|------------:|-----------------:|--------------:|
|      10 |    0.021294 |        4.678 MiB |        0.00 % |
|     100 |    0.256432 |       46.906 MiB |        6.91 % |
|    1000 |    2.492556 |      469.119 MiB |       10.58 % |
|   10000 |   24.844329 |        4.591 GiB |       10.29 % |
|  100000 |  269.365632 |       45.725 GiB |       15.51 % |
| 1000000 | 2783.571640 |      378.214 GiB |       26.36 % |

To speed things up, a rudamentary generic Capnp parser was written natively in
Julia and functions to parse Hits and Stamps using their current schemas were
hand coded (as opposed to being auto-generated from the `hit.capnp` and
`stamp.capnp` files).  Here are the timing and memory stats for the native Julia
parser for the same test cases as before:

|  # Hits |   Time (s)  | Memory allocated | GC percentage |
|--------:|------------:|-----------------:|--------------:|
|      10 |    0.000210 |      147.812 KiB |        0.00 % |
|     100 |    0.001541 |        1.441 MiB |        0.00 % |
|    1000 |    0.018653 |       14.413 MiB |        0.00 % |
|   10000 |    0.242674 |      144.232 MiB |       23.44 % |
|  100000 |    2.038773 |        1.406 GiB |        7.60 % |
| 1000000 |   16.926111 |       11.505 GiB |        6.72 % |

The native Julia Hits and Stamps parser is over two orders of magnitude faster
than using the Python parser from Julia!

To use the native Julia parser, create a `CapnpReader` object by passing a Hits
or Stamps filename to the constructor:

```julia
using SeticoreCapnp

hits_reader = CapnpReader("your_datafile.hits")
```

The `CapnpReader` object acts as a Julia iterator that provides information on
each iteration that can be used to construct Hit or Stamp object, as appropraite
for the data file being parsed.  This is most easily done by using the `map`
function:

```julia
hits = map(SeticoreCapnp.Hit, hits_reader)
```

By default, the `Matrix{Float32}` for the Hit's Filterbank object or the
`Array{ComplexF32,4}` of the Stamp are populated with the relevant data from the
Hits or Stamps file.  If these data fields are not immediately relevant, it is
possible to omit populating them by passing `withdata=false` as a keyward
argument to the Hit or Stamp constructor methods that accept CapnpReader
parameters.

### Julia iterator tricks

Because `CapnpReader` acts like a Julia iterator, if can be used with standard
Julia iterator related functions.  For example, to load only the first `N` Hits,
one can use the `first` function:

```
first_N_hits = map(Hit, first(hits_reader, N))
```

Similarly, to get only the `N`th Hit, one can use `first` in combination with
`Iterators.drop`:

```
hit_N = Hit(first(Iterators.drop(hits_reader, N-1)))
```

These same techniques are equally applicable when working with Stamps files.

## Status of the native Julia interface

Currently the native Julia interface exists as a separate "alternate" way to
parse Hits and Stamps files.  The "standard" `load_hits` and `load_stamps`
functions currently use the Python-based technique for loading Hits and Stamps.
These functions will be changed to use the native Julia interface in a future
version given the performance benefits that the native Julia interface offers.
